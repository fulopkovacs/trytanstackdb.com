## What's next?

You might still have a lot of questions.

What if you don't want to download all of your data at once, because your db is too big (tip: use the `on-demand` sync strategy)? How to do complex mutations on multiple collections at once and still have instant rollbacks (tip: use `createOptimisticAction`)? And probably many more.

Well, that's what the docs are for. They still might be incomplete at places, but the project is moving at a very fast pace and we have some very dedicated folks working on it. In the meanwhile, check out the <a target="_blank" href="https://tlinz.com/discord">Discord channel</a> if you have questions.

## Play with this project

Until then, you can play with this project.

The source code is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/fulopkovacs/trytanstackdb.com">on GitHub</a>, and you can keep monitoring the requests in the Network tab.

> Note that requests won't show up in the Network tab of the DevTools until they are completed (no PENDING state).
> This is because currently they are handled locally by a service worker and this implementation comes with this limitation.

We have a growing list of deep dive articles  that explore more complex topics (such as Optimistic Actions for mutations involving multiple collections). You can view them in the TOC on the left.
