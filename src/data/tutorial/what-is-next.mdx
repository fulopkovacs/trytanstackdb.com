## What's next?

You might still have a lot of questions.

Like what if you don't want to download all of your data at once, because your db is too big (tip: use the `on-demand` sync strategy)? How to do complex mutations on multiple collections at once and still have instant rollbacks (tip: use `createOptimisticAction`)? And probably many more.

Well, that's what the docs are for. They still might be incomplete at places, but the project is moving at a very fast pace and we have some very dedicated folks working on it.
