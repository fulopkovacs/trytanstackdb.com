## What's next?

You might still have a lot of questions.

What if you don't want to download all of your data at once, because your db is too big (tip: use the `on-demand` sync strategy)? How to do complex mutations on multiple collections at once and still have instant rollbacks (tip: use `createOptimisticAction`)? And probably many more.

## Useful resources
I recommend checking out:
- The official <a target="_blank" href="https://tanstack.com/db/latest/docs/quick-start">Quick Start</a> guide if you want to write some code yourself
- The <a target="_blank" href="https://tlinz.com/discord">Discord channel</a> channel if you have questions

## Play with this project

Until then, you can play with this project.

The source code is <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/fulopkovacs/trytanstackdb.com">on GitHub</a>, and you can keep monitoring the requests in the <OpenAPIRequestsPanelLink>_API Requests_ panel</OpenAPIRequestsPanelLink>.

> Keep in mind that this project's architecture is a bit special.
> We had some special constraints:
> - the db had to be local to keep the project financially viable and secure
> - but the API requests had to be observable (for educational purposes).
> Thanks to these, we ended up having:
> - a PGLite db on the client (a Postgres instance in WASM)
> - a service worker that intercepts API requests and forwards them to the API routes that are defined locally (these API routes receive HTTP Requests and give HTTP Responses, just like a normal API would)
>
> All of this architectural complexity is specific to this project, and not required by TanStack DB.

## Deep Dive Articles

We have a growing list of deep dive articles that explore more complex topics (such as Optimistic Actions for mutations involving multiple collections). You can view them in the TOC on the left.
