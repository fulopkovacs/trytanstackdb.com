## Optimistic updates

Besides queries, data mutations also get faster with `tanstack-db`.

Let's check what happens when you rename a project!

<HighLightComponent h_id="editProject">Find the edit button</HighLightComponent>

Rename the project to _"My wonderful project"_. BOOM! It changed instantly
everywhere.

This is the code btw (it's so tiny 🥺):

```ts
projectsCollection.update(id, (project) => {
  project.name = value.name
})
```

The reason why we see the change so fast is that the displayed data is from the cache which gets updated basically instantly, while the changes are synced back to the remote db in the background.

### What happens when the data in the remote db can't be updated?

Let's rename our current project to the name of another existing project (like `Project Beta`).

1. At first, everything is the same (fast update)
2. when the update request fails in the background (because all project names
   must be unique)
   - the changes are immediately rolled back,
   - and a toast message appears with the error message

If the update fails, the mutations are rolled back.

Rollbacks work seamlessly even for mutations that involve multiple collections (see the tutorial article on <LinkToStep articleTitle="Optimistic Actions">Optimistic Actions</LinkToStep>).

**"Okay, but how does the syncing happen? Is it magic???"**. Glad you asked.
Everything is magic if you just believe in it, let me show you how it works in
the next section. ✨
